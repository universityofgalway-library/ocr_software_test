Tá fhios ag na sean daoine an chuis. Ta comhairle eile agam do's na daoine Ega
i nEirinn. Má ta bhur n-intinn deanta suas chum teacht go dti an dtir seo,
foghluim bhur dteanga dhuthchais, mar 'tá go mor mor nios mo meas ar aonneach
o Eirinn go bhfuil a theanga dhuthchais fein aige na mar atá ar an bhfear nach
bhfuil aige acht an Bearla brisde. Nuair a thagann fear Eg. amach annso o
Eirinn, is doigh leis. go bhfuil mil 7 bainne ins gach aon tsrothan. Nuair a
bheidh se annso cupla bliadhain beidh a mhalairt de sgeal aige.
Geabhaidh se obair chruaidh 7 uairibh fada. B'fheidir go ngeabhadh se
obair ar feadh mi no dho 7 annsain caithfidh se imtheacht i n-ait eigin eile
ag cuardach oibre. Sul a ngeabhadh se obair aris beidh a chuid airgid imthighthe
7 annsain beidh fhios aige nach bhfuil an tir seo ag sgeitheadh le mil ? bainne.
B'fhéidir 'san am so go mbeadh se buailte sios leis an bhfiabhras creathach,

gach aon mhaidin chum failte a chur. roimh aonneach go bhfuil an fior righ-fhuil
Eireannach ag ruith tré na chuisleannaibh, Nuair a bheidh an samhradh caithte agad
the old days. The old people know the reason. I have some more advice for the

When a young man comes here from Ireland, he thinks there is milk and honey

work again, his money will be gone, and then he'll know that this country is
not spewing milk and honey. Maybe during this time he'll be struck down with

out of the hospital with his health restored, maybe he'll get work in the woods
or somewhere out in the country.
