180 It's three years since it {the Cc. of 1.7 was overturned in Ireland,
driven from court to court in a yoke, . 
chained by the neck and given to the minister,
put to death amidst great rejoicing.
There were 20,000 at its wake.
It was laid in a tight coffin.
A firm hole was dug for it.
It was cast furiously to the bottom.
The throng set the tombstone above it
and its wicked partisans; .
the devil cast the Church's tithe
at his bosom fellow Lees, the minister/ in a flash of hatred.
There is no good or profit in what was done:
they rushed in with their protectors,
ripped away locks and broke fences(?),
shot at stock running into the pound.
134 It is easy for the minister to work injustice
on any leaseholder in Eoghan's kingdom;
the man without a lease is locked in bondage
paying rent--him the hunt dces not lose.
185 The minister is greedy, false, ovpressive,
drags and plunders us without mercy~--well he knows how--
he is out at dawn with gun
and spike to enforce his violence.
186 If our men run to save their neighbor,
they are felled by spears without mercy;
we have no measures against such actions:
many are carried off dead on stretchers.
