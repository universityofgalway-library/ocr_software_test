Greene Family Letters (continued) , -
J Norris/ Greene (?) to B Norris, June 17 1995, (cont'd nage 4) /6.
I'd like just now to take uv anothersheet of paner, but
I don't know how you'd take to it.
As I wrote this letter, the
Gramophone was going. It
sent me back to the mever-to—be- ,
forgotten days— Do you remember
the dirt-spot in the B'voile par
lor where farmer Tom danced?
One of our records gave a verse of
Where is My Wandering Boy Tonight, Oh
how forciblé you presented yourself before me
Has any record of that vhonogravh survived the
inevitable destruction of all frail things at Ballyvoile?
(across page 1) )
When you are home on your vacation, I'll vray to the Lord to send you
a few reiny éeys
so that you'll have to stay in, & verhens may write me, When you go
home,
don't forget to mention me fondly to Uncle Jim & Aunt Anne
& Jno & Kate & Jim, Also to Mary whenever you happen to
see her or write to her,
Best regard to the home veople to the Caseys, the Gleesons etc.
I must now stop and say Good bye
Your loving cousin
James
If you have occasion to, send my love up to Falkirk
(across pp3c4)
P.S. Just now, as I write and hear the Gramophone I can't help regrett-
ing the absence
of the Casey records from our collections, I can recall many of then
yet.
"An why did he die, why did he die & leave me here in this cold world
with nothing to eat, or sleep, or drink,’
Have you made any donations to the matrimoniel fruitbasket?
Yes, five; three boys & three girls A but one of them is twins. etc etc
It seems Mary the Tailor, near Durrow Station, is dead, Tis she used
