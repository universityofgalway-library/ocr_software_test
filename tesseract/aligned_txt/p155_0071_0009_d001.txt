To the Editor of ‘An Claidheamh Soluis’
I would like to explain to the people of my native country a few things
which they do not understand very well. <A lot of people in the Old Country are
Slandering the Americans. They think that they intend to oppress the people
they freed from the Spanish. They think it is the wish of the Americans to
keep weak every dark-skinned man who is under their government. That is not
so. There are no people in the world more humane, more kind, or more generous
than the Americans. I beseech the God of Grace every day of my life that there
should be in Ireland a government as good and as free as the government the
Americans will give to the people of the Philippines. I have no fault to find
with the people in the Old Country who'have little respect for the Americans,
for that is the sort of thing they hear from no-good people in this country.
There are a lot of them here who have no patriotism; they are down on everything
that does any good for the world at large. They are the people who send the
dirty lying tales across the sea to you. You know what kind of people those
are. You have the same kind in the Orangemen of Ireland.
'Condn Maol' said that President McKinley would fall in the next election.
I tell you, good people, that he will not. He will have a million more votes
than he had in the last election, because the majority of the people are pleased
with what he has done since taking office.
