Eireannach ag ruith tré.na chuisleannaibh, Nuair a bhéidh an samhradh caithte agad

work again, his money will be gone, and then he'll know that this: country ‘is.+ cores
not spewing milk and honey, Maybe during this time he'll be struck down with
the ague, and, alas, that’s the time he'll think of his mother, If he comes
out of the hospital with his health restored, maybe he'll get work in the woods
or somewhere out in the country,
The first day he goes to work, maybe he'll walk straight into a bunch of
poisonous snakes, and I feel sorry for the poor Irishman then, If he gets away
from them without harm, there's another torture awaiting him, In the woods and
lowlands this country is full of big flies = they're as thick as fog -, and I
feel sorry for his skin after the firs day among them, They'll be there
every morning to welcome anyone with tie, royal blood of Ireland coursing in his
veins, When you have finished the summer, you will look like a crane, During
