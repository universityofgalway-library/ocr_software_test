Tå fhios ag na sean daoine an chûis. Tå comhairle eile agam do's na daoine ôga
i neirinn. Må tå bhur n-intinn déanta suas chum teacht go dti an dtir seo,
foghluim bhur dteanga dhüthchais, mar 'tå go mõr mõr nios mõ meas ar aonneach
6 Eirinn go bhfuil a theanga dhüthchais fein aige nå mar atå ar an bhfear nach
bhfuil aige acht an Béarla brisde. Nuair a thagann fear ôg amach annso 5
Eirinn, is dõigh leis go bhfuil mil 7 bainne ins gach aon tsrothån. Nuair a
bheidh se annso cupla bliadhain béidh a mhalairt de sgéal aige.
Geabhaidh se obair chruaidh 7 uairibh fada. B'fhéidir go ngeabhadh sé

ag cuardach oibre. Sul a ngeabhadh se obair aris beidh a chuid airgid imthighthe
7 annsain beidh fhios aige nach bhfuil an tir seo ag sgeitheadh le mil 7 bainne.
B'fhéidir 'san am so go mbéadh se buailte sios leis an bhfiabhras creathach,

An chéad lå ag dul ag obair dô b'fheidir go siubhlôchaidh sé direach

gach aon mhaidin chum failte a chur roimh aonneach go bhfuil an fior righ-fhuil
Eireannach ag ruith tré na chuisleannaibh. Nuair a bheidh an samhradh, caithte agad
the old days. The old people know the reason. I have some more advice for the
young people of Ireland. If your mind is made up to come to this country, learn
your native language, because there is far more respect for anyone from Ireland
who speaks his native language than for the person who speaks only broken English,
When a young man comes here from Ireland, he thinks there is milk and honey
in every stream. When he has been here for a couple of years, he'll have a

He'll get hard work and long hours. Maybe he'll get work for a month or
