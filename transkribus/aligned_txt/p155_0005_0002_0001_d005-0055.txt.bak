Greene Family Letters (continued)
J Norris/ Greene (?) to B Norris, June 17 1905, (cont'd page 4) /6.
I'd like just now to take up anothersheet of paper, but
I don't know how you'd take to it.
As I wrote this letter, the
Gramophone was going. It
sent me back to the never-to-be¬
forgotten days- Do you remember
the dirt-spot in the B'voile par
lor where farmer Tom danced?
One of our records gave a verse of
Where is My Wandering Boy Tonight. Oh
how forcible you presented yourself before me
Has any record of that phonograph survived the
inevitable destruction of all frail things at Ballyvoile?
(across page 1)
When you are home on your vacation, I'll pray to the Lord to send you
a few rainy days
so that you'll have to stay in, & perhaps may write me. When you go
home,
don't forget to mention me fondly to Uncle Jim & Aunt Anne
& Jno & Kate & Jim. Also to Mary whenever you happen to
see her or write to her.
Best regard to the home people to the Caseys, the Gleesons etc.
I must now stop and say Good bye
Your loving cousin
James
If you have occasion to, send my love up to Falkirk
(across pp3&4)
P.S. Just now, as I write and hear the Gramophone I can't help regrett¬
ing the absence
of the Casey records from our collections.
I can recall many of them
yet.
'Ah why did he die, why did he die & leave me here in this cold world
with nothing to eat, or sleep, or drink.'
Have you made any donations to the matrimonial fruitbasket?
Yes, five; three boys & three girls A but one of them is twins. etc etc
Tis she used
It seems Mary the Tailor, near Durrow Station, is dead.
