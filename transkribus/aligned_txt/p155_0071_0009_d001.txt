Budh mhaith liom taisbeaint dom dhaoine duthchasach féin neithe beaga
nå fuil tuigsint mhaith aca ortha. Tå mórån daoine insan Sean-tir ag
caitheamh tarcuisne 7 aithise ar na hAmericanaibh. Is dóigh leó go bhfuil
siad chum na daoine bochta a shaoradar ó-s na Spainneachaibh a chur faoi
dhaor-smachd. Is doigh leó gurab é mian na nAmericanach gach aon fhear dorcha
atá få n-a Riaghailt a chur faoi leathtrom. Ni hamhlaidh sin. Ni'l aon
daoine san domhan níos daonna, níos cineálta, ná nios féile nå na hAmericånaigh.
Do ghuidhfinn chum Dia na ngrås gach lå dhem shaoghal chum riaghailt a bheith
i nEirinn chomh maith chomh saor leis an riaghailt a thabharfadh na hAmericånaigh
do-s na Filibínigh. Ni'l aon locht agam-sa le faghail leis na daoine san
Sean-thir mar gheall ar an mi-mheas atá aca ar na hAmericánaigh, mar is é
sin an rud a chloiseann siad ó-s na fearaibh buidhe insan tir seo. Tá
dream aca annso ná fuil aon tír-ghrådh ionnta, tå siad anuas ar gach aon
rud a ghnidheann aon mhaitheas do'n domhan uile go léir. Sin iad na daoine
a chuireann na sgéala salach bréagach tarsna na fairrge go dti sibh-se. Tá
'fhios agaibh an cineal daoine iad sud. Tá an samhail céadna agaibh-se i
bhFearaibh Cråisde na hEireann.

To the Editor of 'An Claidheamh Soluis'
I would like to explain to the people of my native country a few things
which they do not understand very well. A lot of people in the Old Country are
slandering the Americans. They think that they intend to oppress the people
they freed from the Spanish. They think it is the wish of the Americans to
keep weak every dark-skinned man who is under their government. That is not
so. There are no people in the world more humane, more kind, or more generous
than the Americans. I beseech the God of Grace every day of my life that there
should be in Ireland a government as good and as free as the government the
Americans will give to the people of the Philippines. I have no fault to find
with the people in the Old Country who have little respect for the Americans,
for that is the sort of thing they hear from no-good people in this country.
There are a lot of them here who have no patriotism; they are down on everything
that does any good for the world at large. They are the people who send the
dirty lying tales across the sea to you. You know what kind of people those
are. You have the same kind in the Orangemen of Ireland.
'Conan Maol' said that President McKinley would fall in the next election.
I tell you, good people, that he will not. He will have a million more votes
than he had in the last election, because the majority of the people are pleased
with what he has done since taking office.
