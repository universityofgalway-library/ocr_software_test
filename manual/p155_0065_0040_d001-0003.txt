Dear Cousin Neal:
Your welcome letter was received, and me and your Aunt Bridget
thank you kindly for the money you sent. We had seven Masses said for your
Father and Mother. God rest their souls.
Your cousin Hughie Dougherty was hung in Londonderry last Friday
for killing a policeman. May God rest his soul and may God's curse be on
Jimmy Rodgers, the informer. May his soul burn in hell, God forgive me.
Times are not as bad as they might be. The herring is back and
everyone, or nearly everyone, has a boat or an interest in one and the
price of fish is good, thanks be to God. The black and Tans are terrible.
They go through the country in their Lorries and shoot the poor people
down in the fields where they are working. God's curse on them.
Your Uncle Danny took a shot at one of them yesterday from the
hedge, but he had too much drink and missed them. God's curse on the drink.
Well, I hope this letter finds you and your family well and happy,
and we all join in sending you our best wishes. May God bless you all,
and sorry you are not with us.
The Dougherty's are a hundred strong men now, since the best of
them stopped going to America. They will soon cover the whole country-
side.
Father Whelan, who baptized you, and who is now very feeble,
sends his blessing. May God rest you and yours and keep you from sickness
and sudden death.
Your Aunt Grace
P. S. Things might be worse than they are. Every police barrack and
every Protestant Church in the county has been burned down. Thanks be to
God.
