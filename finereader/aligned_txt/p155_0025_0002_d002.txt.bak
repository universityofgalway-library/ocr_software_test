1836 April 2
180 It’s three years since it /the C< of Ij_/ was overturned in Ireland,
driven from court to court in a yoke, chained by the neck and given to the minister,
Irish Church
Temporalities Act (?)
put to death amidst great rejoicing.
1S1 There were 20,OCX! at its wake.
It was laid in a tight coffin.
A firm hole was dug for it.
It was cast furiously to the bottom.
182 The throng set the tombstone above it
and its wicked partisans;
the devil cast the Church’s tithe
at his bosom fellow /i.e., the minister^ in a flash of hatred.
183 There is no good or profit in what was done: they rushed in with their protectors, ripped away locks and broke fencesC?),
i.e., before the Act was massed
shot at stock running into the pound.
134 It is easy for the minister to work injustice on any leaseholder in Eoghan’s kingdom;
the man without a lease is locked in bondage paying rent—him the hunt does not lose.
185 The minister is greedy, false, oppressive, drags and plunders us without mercy—well he knows how--he is out at dawn with gun
and snike to enforce his violence.
186 If our men run to save their neighbor, they are felled by spears without mercy; we have no measures against such actions: many are carried off dead on stretchers.
