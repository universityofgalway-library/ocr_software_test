Greene family Letters (continued)
J Norris/ Greene (?) to B Norris, June 17 1905, (cont’d nage 4) /6.
I’d like just now to take up another sheet of paper, but
I don’t know how you’d tak:e to it.
As I wrote this letter, the
Gramophone was going. It
sent me back to the never-to-be-	,
forgotten da.ys- Do you remember
the dirt-spot in the B’voile par
lor where f9,rmer Tom danced?
One of our records gave a verse of
Where is My 7/andering Boy Tonight, Oh
how forcible you presented yourself before me
Has any record of that phonograph survived the
inevita,ble destruction of a.11 frail things at Bally\7’oile?
(across page 1)
When you are home on your vacation, I’ll pray to the Lord to send you
a few rainy days
so that you’ll have to stay in, & uerhaps may write me, 'Jhen you go
home,
don’t forget to mention me fondly to Uncle Jim & Aunt Anne
& Jno & Ka,te & Jim, Also to Mary whenever you happen to
see her or vzrite to her.
Best regard to the home people to the Caseys, the Gleesons etc,
I must nov/ stop and say Good bye
Your loving cousin
James
If you have occasion to, send ray love up to Falkirk
(across pp3&4)
P.S, Just now, as I v/rite and hear the Gramophone I can’t help regrett
ing the absence
of the Casey records from our collections, I can recall many of them
yet,
’Ah why did he die, why did he die & leave me here in this cold world
with nothing to eat, or sleep, or drink,’
Have you made any donations to the matrimonial fruitbasket?
Yes, five; three boys & three girls A but one of them is twins, etc etc
It seems Mary the Tailor, near Durrow Station, is dead. Tig ghe used
say; Vack a thee

all ray Irish except the coramonpl^ Cunees ta tu Currig urth Pogeu
