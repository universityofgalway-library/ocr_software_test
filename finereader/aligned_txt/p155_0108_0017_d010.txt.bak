Mv Deak Tone : Though you have not written to me, I heal^^ .S
from an accidental quarter, of your having some idea of a trip^M
across the Atlantic. 1 have made some American acquaintance'Ll
here, who are both opulent and respectable. One of whom. Dr.
Edwai’ds, a peison of immense landed property, is about makinf^ >9
an Irish tour. I have, therefore, given him a letter to you, '
which he M ill deliver in Dublin. He is a great farmer, and I '
have gathei-ed from him that he is very desirous to carry away ■
from Ireland, a cargo of Irish families, farmers as well as man
ufacturers ; and, from my conversation with him, he appears ■
honest, intelligent, and spirited. That his acquaintance, and, '
possibly, a connection with him, may be serviceable to you, was ’J
the very first idea which occupied my mind, and I therefore im- j
mediately offered him, as favors conferred upon him, letters to ;
my friends in Dublin, Mr. Sweetman and Counsellor Tone; ‘
you will then have an opportunity of sounding him, nearly or ■
more remotely respecting yourself, from these documents I write
you. He is a great admirer of the North of Ireland. He was,
a by his own confession, a great Aristocrat in America, and J
changed principles from conviction. He is a doctor of laws and w
physic, and, I believe, is a Judge in Philadelphia. He loves the ''
I French, and detests the combination against them. He is very 1
gentle and frank in his manners, and grateful for every atten- J
tion. With affectionate regard to Russell, I remain your faith- S
ful friend,	|
WM. TODD JONES. |
P. S. I have spent another day with my American compa-
nions and learn that Edwards is a Judge of the Common Pleas <
at Philadelphia, is possessed of large tracts of territory, and
I'cquires settlers. I have puffed you off to him at no very merci-I
ful rate of flattery; so pray act up to my picture.—God bless you.

Dear Friend : I have just this instant heard from Simon
^^Guire that you leave town to-night I can scarcely believe
ftitt you would entirely break yourself away from this country,
nd from me, amongst tiie rest, without calling on me, or even
^writing a line. You know, and I timst will always be convinc-
U, teat my friendship and affectionate regard for you is most
tndiminished. It is not of tliat nature to shake by adversity,
which God knows how soon it may be my lot to undergo.
^Wherever you are, you shall always command a steady friend
tin tins country, as long as I reside here. Write to me, at least,
f/when you reach your destination, and as often as may suit your
K convenience. Perhaps your letters may be useful to me for re-
1 gulating my future settlement in life.—God bless you. Give
1 my most affectionate compliments to Mrs. Tone, and believe
Ji me, very sincerely, your’s,

Extracts of Letters to and from America.
Dear Tone : Our internal politics are not touch altered since
you left this. Grattan and his pai*ty have been engaging the
Catholics to address his Majesty, jointly with their fellow-
' citizens, for final emancipation. This they have refused, unless
reform be added to it, and that the party of Grattanites should
take a lead in the business. Reform does not accord witli these
gentlemen’s views, and they are not yet able to swallow such a
pill, but still they continue tlie intercourse, and I am inclined
to teink they would concede. The last meeting was on Friday,
and the next will be on Tuesday. The result of it shall be com
municated to you tee first opportunity. At present I flunk all
meetings of the kind are futile, I mean aggregate meetings for
addresses and declarations, and that it would be much wiser for
us calmly to await the issue of another campaign or two.

Dear Tone : The new spapers will uiform you of the French
affau's, and you will, I doubt not, have felt tee same hopes and
tears that we did respecting peace. We are now, however, in
